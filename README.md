# OMDb-Movie-Search-App

This was my final project in my CS112 Programming in JavaScript Course. This Movie Search App was a pain because the OMDb API was made in a very annoying way, and the documentation wasn't the best. The documentation for using episodes does not work, and it took me forever trying to find the parameters needed to get the Episodes to work (I had to do some deep searching just to find it). The OMDb API had extremely terrible decisions, and I really hope they fix their flaws, as it makes using the API twice as hard to retrieve certain information (in this case, Episodes).

In the end, the rest of the Movie Search App was easy. It was just Episodes that got me really upset due to the unnecessary extra work that was needed because the creators of the API made some annoying decisions.

Got 100 / 100.
